# Shopping List

This should be a minimal website for uploading a complete shopping list. People enter their needs, already with some shop distribution and volunteer pick and deliver them. 
You can sign up as a healthy volunteer for distribution or pick-up. For simplicity people don't have to be signed up, but may have to answer a local security question (who is our mayor, what is this region most famous for?).
The aim is: No individual purchasing, so that only tested/monitored people interact (COVID-19).
